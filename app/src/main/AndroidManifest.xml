    <!-- 
        Technical Architecture Overview:
        This Manifest file outlines the necessary configurations for the Social Media Automation Tool.
        It includes essential permissions, component registrations, and metadata required for the application
        to function effectively in automating social media tasks across multiple platforms. 
    -->

    <!-- Required to allow internet access for social media operations -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <!-- 
        Technical Detail: 
        The INTERNET permission enables continuous network communication, necessary for interacting with 
        social media APIs and performing automation tasks. 
    -->

    <!-- 
        Required to read/write data to external storage for saving logs or configuration files.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <!-- 
        Implementation Detail: 
        These permissions facilitate the application's ability to manage media files and logs, ensuring 
        smooth operation and user-configured content management.

        <!-- 
            Main Activity Configuration:
            This activity serves as the entry point for the application, providing users with access to 
            the automation functionalities.
        -->
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
            <intent-filter>

            AutomationService Registration:
            This service runs in the background 24/7, executing scheduled social media automation tasks 
            seamlessly without user intervention.
        -->
        <service android:name=".AutomationService"
                 android:exported="false">
            <!-- 
                Best Practice:
                The service is marked as non-exported to prevent external applications from starting it, 
                maintaining the integrity and security of the automation processes.
            -->

        <!-- 
            Metadata Configuration:
            This is used to provide additional settings or configurations that the application may require 
            during runtime or installation.

### Key Components Explained:

- **Permissions**: The declaration of `INTERNET`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions is essential for enabling network capabilities and managing file storage, which are critical for the functionality of MadHub in automating social media tasks.
  
- **Component Registration**: The `MainActivity` serves as the user interface entry point, while the `AutomationService` is vital for background operations, ensuring that automation tasks run continuously, embodying best practices in Android service management.

- **Best Practices**: The implementation of security measures, such as non-exporting the service, is crucial to safeguard the application's automation processes, thus enhancing overall application security and stability.
